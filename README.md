# Project Name: Car Crash Data Analysis

## Description:
This project contains data analysis of car crashes within a specific location over a certain period of time. The dataset includes various parameters such as year, month, day, weekend, hour, collision type, injury type, primary factors, reported location, latitude, and longitude. The analysis aims to understand patterns and trends in car crashes within the specified area.

## Visualization:
The analysis is visualized using Tableau and includes the following visualizations:

Line Chart - Number of Car Crashes per Year:
This visualization showcases the trend of car crashes over the years, providing insights into any changes or patterns in the frequency of accidents.

Bar Chart - Number of Car Crashes for Each Day of the Week:
This visualization displays the distribution of car crashes across different days of the week, allowing for an understanding of which days experience higher or lower incidents of accidents.

Bubble Map - Type of Injury and Number of Car Crashes at Each Location:
Utilizing color, size, and a map interface, this visualization represents the type of injury and the corresponding number of car crashes at various locations. It offers a spatial understanding of the distribution of accidents and the severity of injuries.

Bar Chart - Number of Car Crashes for Each Primary Factor:
This visualization presents the frequency of car crashes based on primary factors contributing to the accidents. It helps in identifying the key factors leading to car crashes within the analyzed area.

## How to Use:
